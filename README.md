## Install Necessary Softwares

If you're contributing, before doing anything else, install the following Softwares, these are the necessary tool to run this Bot:

| Software | Version | Additional Notes |
| - | - | - |
| Node.js | `12.x` | [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org) |
| npm | `6.x` | Come bundled with Node.js. We used the bundled version, no LTS releases. |
| git | `2.x` | [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/) |
| MongoDB Compass* | `1.x` | [Download MongoDB Compass Community](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)<br/>This is not a required tool, this is just for database visualization. |

**Not Required / Optional*

You are also going to need to install a Code Editor if you do not have one already. There are a lot of them out there, but what we recommend are [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [Atom Code Editor](https://atom.io). Either one of these two are good, pick which one you like.

## Getting the Bot into the Server

This bot requires the `Administrator` permission to run. We generated a link for you that will do that, all you need is a Client ID. Here's how you can get your bot up:

Go into the Discord's Website, then go to the Developer Portal and Sign in. You can use [this](https://discord.com/developers/applications) link.

1. Press the `New Application` button on the top right of the screen. Then give your application a name and press `Create`.
2. Select your new Application by clicking on it.
3. Go to the Bot section.
4. Press the Add Bot, and press Confirm

5. Go back to `General Information`.
6. Copy the Client ID.

![Get Client ID](./src/images/get-client-id.png)

7. Go to this [link](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#257038), scroll down and enter in your client ID. Then Click on the link generated at the bottom.

![Get Server Permissions](./src/images/Get-into-server.png)

8. Then it's going to ask which server you want the bot in. Pick the server you want and click Select. Then, It's going to show a form full of permissions, scroll down and click `Authorize`. Finish the captcha.

...and you're done, your bot should slide in to your server. There is still some stuff to do to get it running.

## Running It Locally

To run this bot locally, follow these steps:

1. Go to the folder where your cloned repo is.
2. Create a new file inside it called `.env`.
3. Inside the `.env` file, add your discord token like the example:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-token
```

You can get your discord token through the discord portal in the `Bot` section of your application.

4. Then inside the `.env` file, add a prefix like the example below (The default prefix is "!"). This is how you're going to call the bot later on. Ex:

   ```dotenv
   PREFIX="your-prefix"
   ```
5. Add another variable named `JOIN_LEAVE_CHANNEL` with a text channel where you want to log new user welcomes, the default channel is "introductions". Ex:

   ```dotenv
   JOIN_LEAVE_CHANNEL="introductions"
   ```
6. Add another variable named `COMMAND_LOG_CHANNEL` with a text channel where you want the bot to log the commands that were called, the default channel is "commmand-logs". Ex:

   ```dotenv
   COMMAND_LOG_CHANNEL="command-logs"
   ```
7. Add another variable named `BOT_LOG_CHANNEL` with a text channel where you want the bot to log when the bot is up/online, the default channel is "bot-logs". Ex:

   ```dotenv
   BOT_LOG_CHANNEL="bot-logs"
   ```


   This is what the whole `.env` would look like without the comments: ![dotEnv File](src/images/.envFile.png)
8. Open up a terminal in the folder. (If you are using VSCode, you can press `CTRL + `` Shortcut)
9. Type the following command and hit enter:

```bash
npm i
```

10. Now, you can edit the code.
11. After you're done with that, type the following command and hit enter to run the bot:

```bash
node index
```

That's all. The bot should log an embed with the time it was woken up and account used inside the channel you specified inside the `.env` file with the variable `BOT_LOG_CHANNEL`. The default value is "bot-logs". If you don't have this channel, it will not log it.
